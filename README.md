# CS 207: Discrete Structures
**Disclaimer**: These notes are how I understand/interpret the lectures.
It's likely that I have made mistakes, or haven't explained things in the best way.
I have also added exercises based on the doubts that I myself get, or those that are asked in class, or just to add some useful proofs.
Also idk if I will have the time to do this for all lectures :)
