# CS 207: Discrete Structures
**Disclaimer**: These notes are how I understand/interpret the lectures.
It's likely that I have made mistakes, or haven't explained things in the best way.
I have also added exercises based on the doubts that I myself get, or those that are asked in class, or just to add some useful proofs.
Also idk if I will have the time to do this for all lectures :)

Full credits to Kavya Gupta for making Lecture 13 notes (Lecture 16 in my numbering
as I count tutorials). His notes are more concise and quicker to read than mine, do 
read that if you prefer it. I rewrote what I understood from it just to keep the style consistent.
